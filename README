Assignment Goals

    To learn about key storage system concepts: logging and transactions
    To provide the basis for project FS, where you will build a reliable file system.

Overview of Project

    In projects ADisk and FS, you will construct a user-level library that presents the abstraction of a reliable file system called RFS. In order to manage the complexity, you will implement this system in several phases, each of which presents a successively higher-level abstraction. You will be given the abstraction of a raw disk interface. On top of this you will build

        An atomic disk
        A reliable multi-level tree
        A reliable flat file system
        A reliable directory-based file system (RFS)

    This project, deals only with step 1 above. It is very important to do an excellent job on this part of the project, or you will have significant problems in the next part.
